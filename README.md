# Llama Shop

Hello and welcome to the code for my shop!

I am a Twitch Streamer, Youtube creator, and a software developer. I decided to make my own shop to sell my merch and other products. I am also using this as a chance to learn how to make a fully functional e-commerce website.

This is not a demo, this is not a test, this is a real shop, where people can purchase real products. My products are going to be fulfilled by Printify, and I will be using Stripe as my payment processor.
